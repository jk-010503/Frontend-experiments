This project creates an impressive web page that showcases a captivating "Shadow of a Dog" animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page features a beautifully styled interface with a gradient background and smoothly integrated animation controls. Users can select different animations from a dropdown menu, and the chosen animation is then displayed on a canvas.

The JavaScript code drives the animation, managing the character's state and rendering the animation frames on the canvas. The sprite sheet, containing various animation frames, is loaded, and animations are organized into different states, such as 'stand,' 'jump,' 'run,' and more. As the user selects an animation from the dropdown, the code dynamically switches to the corresponding state and smoothly animates the character.

This project offers an engaging and interactive user experience, combining artistic design with technical finesse to bring a charming "Shadow of a Dog" to life on the web. The code structure is clear and efficient, making it easy to understand and customize for your animations or web-based games. Inspired by a tutorial.
