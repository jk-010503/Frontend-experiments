This project is an interactive audio visualizer built using JavaScript and the Three.js library. It allows users to select an MP3 audio file, which is then visualized through a dynamic 3D sphere. The audio is analyzed in real-time, and the amplitude and frequency data are used to manipulate the sphere's vertices, creating a visually stunning distortion effect that corresponds to the music's rhythm and intensity. Users can interact with the visualization by clicking to start or pause audio playback. The code is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes while providing feedback about the currently playing audio file. To enhance the visual impact, the project also offers the flexibility to increase the amplitude of the distortion for a more pronounced effect. Overall, this project showcases the fusion of audio and 3D graphics, providing an engaging and immersive experience for users as they explore the dynamic world of music through visual art.
